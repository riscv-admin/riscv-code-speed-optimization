== Priorities

The following projects are currently in progress

1. Performance Tracking System
2. Compiler optimization for the B extension

The following priority list for the remaining projects was most recently reviewed at the SIG meeting of 4 January 2020, where each person present was asked to choose their top two priorities for projects to work on

== Candidate projects

=== Research

* link:linker-optimizations.adoc[extension of optimization in the linker]
* machine learning in the compiler
* characterizing what optimizations are RISC-V specific

=== Development

* a collection of general RISC-V link:gcc-optimizations.adoc[GCC optimizations]
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `Zfh` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `B` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `J` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `P` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `V` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `Zfinx` extension
* machine learning outside the compiler
* superoptimization
* compiler support for profiling, including loop level profiling
* general LLVM optimizations
* general optimizations for other compilers
* `-menable-experimental-extensions` option for GCC
* version of `-msave-restore` optimized for speed
* compiler//library optimization for the V8 run-time environment
* compiler//library optimization for the OpenJDK run-time environment
* compiler//library optimization for the SpiderMonkey run-time environment
* optimization for specific applications, e.g. OpenCV, crypto
* trace for optimization
* Glibc optimization

=== Process

* FSF copyright assignment in RISC-V mirror repositories
* allocation of vendor specific linker relocations
* ongoing benchmarking (and regressions in benchmarking), including competitive analysis, identifying suitable benchmarks to use and support for tracing
* determination of baseline code speed benchmarks for each language supported by RISC-V
* documentation, for example to facilitate writing a scheduler, what can be standardize/parameterized, what are the "hints" in RISC-V documentation
* buildbot infrastructure for open source CI and measurement (tied into benchmarking and tracing)
* determine the impact of code density on code speed, including cache impacts
