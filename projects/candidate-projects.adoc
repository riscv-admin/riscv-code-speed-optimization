== Priorities

The following priority list was agreed at the SIG meeting of 16 November 2020, where each person present was asked to choose their top two priorities for projects to work on

|=============================================================================
| _Project_                                                 | _Count_
| Continuous integration and test, benchmarking and tracing |      8
| Compiler/library optimization for `B` extension           |      7

== Candidate projects

=== Research

* link:linker-optimizations.adoc[extension of optimization in the linker]
* machine learning in the compiler

=== Development

* a collection of general RISC-V link:gcc-optimizations.adoc[GCC optimizations]
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `Zfh` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `B` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `J` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `P` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `V` extension
* compiler/library (GCC/LLVM/IAR) optimization for `Zfinx` extension
* machine learning outside the compiler
* superoptimization
* compiler support for profiling, including loop level profiling
* general LLVM optimizations
* general optimizations for other compilers
* `-menable-experimental-extensions` option for GCC
* version of `-msave-restore` optimized for speed
* optimization for specific applications, e.g. OpenCV, crypto

=== Process

* FSF copyright assignment in RISC-V mirror repositories
* allocation of vendor specific linker relocations
* ongoing benchmarking (and regressions in benchmarking), including competitive analysis, identifying suitable benchmarks to use and support for tracing
* determination of baseline code speed benchmarks for each language supported by RISC-V
* documentation, for example to facilitate writing a scheduler, what can be standardize/parameterized, what are the "hints" in RISC-V documentation
* buildbot infrastructure for open source CI and measurement (tied into benchmarking and tracing)
* determine the impact of code density on code speed, including cache impacts
