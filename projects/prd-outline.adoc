|================================================================================

== Requirements

=== Context

Explain the project in sufficient detail for the following sections to make sense.

=== Phasing

Some projects may represent 10s of engineer years of effort over a number of years. In these cases, the project should be broken into a number of phases, lasting 3-6 months.  Each phase should be logically coherent and have meaningful deliverables, such that just completing a single phase is a useful body of work.

Note that is quite usual for the PRD to describe a multi-phase project, but only provide detailed planning for the first phase, with planning the next phase being one of the deliverables of each phase.

=== Outline plan and timescale

The problem must be sufficiently well analysed that it can be planned in sufficient detail to provide meaningful estimates of effort required and likely timescales.

=== Prerequisites

* Equipment needed, and where this can be obtained
* Skills required by engineers
* Other prerequisites - for example those working on FSF tools will need FSF copyright agreement in place

=== Deliverables

The outputs of the project.  For projects of any length it is reasonable to have interim deliverables.  The success of the project is measured through its deliverables.

A monthly report to the SIG is a routine deliverables for all projects, which will cover
- key progress in the past month
- table showing tasks to be done, in progress, complete and verified
- test/benchmark results
- updates to the risk register
- plans for the next month

=== Milestones

In order to be program managed, the project must have quantifiable milestones.  Typically 1-2 per month.  It is important that the milestones are objectively measurable.

=== Costs

* equipment costs
* license costs
* personnel costs

The costs should not be in cash terms, but in terms of equipment required, or engineer months/years of efforts required (and type of engineer required).

== Risk register

Risks are assessed by the Impact (I) they have on the project from 1 (minor) to project killer (3) and by the Likelihood (L) of the risk occurring from 1 (10% chance) through 10 (100% chance).  The two are multiplied to give an overall Risk Factor (R).  Mitigation must be provided for any risk with I = 3 or R >= 10.

| _Risk_  | _I_ | _L_ | _R_ | _Mitigation_
| No silicon available for testing | 2 | 6 | 12 | Use cycle accurate models
| Too few engineers committed by members |

RISC-V International to fund contract engineers to do the work
|=============================================================================

The risk register will be maintained on an ongoing basis.

== Support

A project is only useful if members are willing to back it with real resources, which can be in kind or in cash.  Generally a project should only go ahead under the aegis of RISC-V if multiple members are backing it.
